To help you document your experience using Copilot, I need a bit more information from you:

What code did Copilot generate for you?

Please specify which script(s) or file(s) you want to document.
Did you modify the script?

If yes, what modifications did you make and why?
How did you test the script?

Please share your testing process and results.
How do you usually run the script?

If there are any special instructions or dependencies, let me know.
Once you provide these details, Iâ€™ll create a clear section for your experience and instructions on running the script in your README. If you want, you can also upload the script or relevant code so I can reference exact details.
